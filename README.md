## üß† TL;DR

Tired of zoning out while studying?

Using real-time webcam ML, window tracking, and Gemini API sass ‚Äî YoMama makes sure you're always **focused**, or else.

##  Opportunity

LLMs and productivity AI tools are booming, but most are too polite or passive.
**YoMama** fills that gap by offering an agentic, emotionally expressive AI that adapts to your behavior, with real consequences (popups, sound, and social shame).

Think: your mom yelling at you, but with generative sass and ML-powered presence detection.
